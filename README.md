Zenta (CHAIN) is a Substrate-based, forkless PoS blockchain for communication and data storage. The construction of a fork-free blockchain with Substrate enables Zentalk and Zentavault to make the perfect provision for our ecosystem. Zentameshnet is the secret part to allow Zentalk user communication offline 2 offline. Staking with Zentanodes will uphold the nodes in the Zentameshnet.
